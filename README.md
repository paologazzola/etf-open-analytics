# ETF Open Analytics

ETF Open Analytics is an open-source project for scraping and analyzing historical ETF (Exchange-Traded Funds) data.

It uses:
- **Python** for data collection  
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage  
- **GitHub Actions** to schedule and automate daily updates  

This is a **proof-of-concept project**: the dataset currently includes only a subset of ETFs and partial historical data.  
However, the architecture is designed to be extensible, and it can be expanded to include more complete data and support deeper, more accurate portfolio analysis, backtesting, and machine learning applications.

## ETF Scraper

The `etf_scraper` module is responsible for downloading and storing historical ETF price data.

### Features

- Retrieves daily historical prices using [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) via `yfinance`
- Stores data into a PostgreSQL database (e.g. [Render](https://render.com))
- Keeps track of the latest saved price per ETF
- Automatically updates missing days on each run
- Uses GitHub Actions to run daily via scheduled job

### Database Tables

- `etf`: contains ETF metadata (ISIN, description, region, replication method, etc.)
- `etf_price`: contains historical daily prices for each ETF

### Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r etf_scraper/requirements.txt

# Run the updater manually
python etf_scraper/main.py
```

Make sure to create a .env file with the following variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>
TICKER_FIELD=yahoo_symbol
```

### GitHub Action
The workflow .github/workflows/fetch.yml runs the scraper daily using:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Every day at 6:00 UTC
```

To use it:
- Add `DATABASE_URL` as a GitHub secret
- Add `TICKER_FIELD` as a GitHub environment variable
